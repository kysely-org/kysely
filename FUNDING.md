# Funding

Kysely is an MIT-licensed open-source project and is completely free to use - and will remain so.

Kysely is a labor of love. We do this in our free time.

We do not accept donations.

- Getting paid for open-source won't make us put more time and effort into open-source.
  We have family, friends, and other hobbies and interests.

- We work in the tech industry, full-time, as software developers. We are comfortable as-is.

- We don't believe in freelance open-source as a stable source of income for the long term.
  We have mouths to feed, and careers to maintain.

- Sponsored projects tend to be affected by big sponsors. We want to keep Kysely away
  from companies' and VCs' opinions and business needs.

- Kysely is escapism for us. We don't want it to feel like another job.


Instead of donating to us, we encourage you to support meaningful causes or other open-source projects in need of funding.

Thank you for supporting Kysely through your usage, contributions, and feedback.
