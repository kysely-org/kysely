# ~~Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct~~ Kysely Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

~~We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our~~
~~community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body~~
~~size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender~~
~~identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,~~
~~nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity~~
~~and orientation.~~

~~We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,~~
~~diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.~~

Don't be an asshole.
You are not entitled to other people's time, energy, or attention.

That's it. That's the pledge.

## Our Standards

~~Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our~~
~~community include:~~

~~* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people~~
~~* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences~~
~~* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback~~
~~* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,~~
  ~~and learning from the experience~~
~~* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the~~
  ~~overall community~~

~~Examples of unacceptable behavior include:~~

~~* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or~~
  ~~advances of any kind~~
~~* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks~~
~~* Public or private harassment~~
~~* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email~~
  ~~address, without their explicit permission~~
~~* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a~~
  ~~professional setting~~

Don't be an asshole.
You are not entitled to other people's time, energy, or attention.

Examples of being an asshole or entitled include:

* Probably not the best idea to come in complaining and not having minimal respect to develop some basic sentences.
  > what is the migration_lock ?? why we have this in the database - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/973
* Probably not the best idea to attack the maintainer after he answered succinctly (out of character) for whatever reason (context switch? busy?).
  > You got any more of them there examples buster? - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/677#issuecomment-2019876074
* Probably not the best idea to come in all yelling and demanding stuff.
  > NO documentation about error handling!!!!
  > I am really confused that the docs doesnt have anything about error handling
  > this is a mandataory things to add!! - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/1217
* Probably not the best idea to tone police the maintainer after he spent time explaining library philosophy, and to publicly refuse to contribute something you demanded.
  > I'm sorry fella but with your tone I really don't feel like it. Good luck - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/709#issuecomment-1727617260
* Probably not the best idea to question the maintainer's decisions after properly answering your question, and to be entitled for JavaScript skill issue help after the issue is closed.
  > I don't understand your answer and closing the issue. - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/527#issuecomment-1577383794
* Probably not the best idea to jump into closed issues and be entitled to other people's efforts.
  > why on earth there is no mention of this in the documentation? - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/649#issuecomment-2430854835
* Probably not the best idea to not search existing issues, and then ask the maintainer to spend time doing it.
  > could you please provide numbers of duplicated issues to explore the topic? - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/762#issuecomment-1801951960
* Probably not the best idea to sarcastically suggest the maintainer is not helpful while using his hard work for free.
  > Most helpful man in the world - https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/issues/762#issuecomment-2404599281
* Probably not the best idea to side with the asshole/entitled by upvoting them or downvoting us.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

~~Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of~~
~~acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in~~
~~response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,~~
~~or harmful.~~

~~Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject~~
~~comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are~~
~~not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation~~
~~decisions when appropriate.~~

We are here in our free time. We are not getting paid to serve and please you.

We will not tolerate assholes or entitled behavior.

We are capable of banning you from the GitHub organization, Discord server, or any 
other community space we manage. Don't make us do it.

## Scope

~~This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when~~
~~an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.~~
~~Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,~~
~~posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed~~
~~representative at an online or offline event.~~

Relevant to all repositories in the Kysely GitHub organization, the Kysely Discord 
server, and any other community space managed by Kysely.

## Enforcement

~~Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be~~
~~reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at~~
~~Kysely's GitHub repositories and Discord server.~~
~~All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.~~

~~All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the~~
~~reporter of any incident.~~

Report to us anyone who is being an asshole or entitled.
We will take appropriate action if necessary.

## Enforcement Guidelines

~~Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining~~
~~the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:~~

We might do these things:

~~### 1. Correction~~

**Community Impact**: ~~Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed~~
~~unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.~~

Someone being an asshole or entitled.

**Consequence**: ~~A private, written warning from community leaders, providing~~
~~clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the~~
~~behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.~~

We might return the favor (we're not perfect), ignore you, edit/close/lock/delete 
your post/comment, or ban you. There is no strike system.

~~### 2. Warning~~

~~**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series~~
~~of actions.~~

~~**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No~~
~~interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with~~
~~those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This~~
~~includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels~~
~~like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or~~
~~permanent ban.~~

~~### 3. Temporary Ban~~

~~**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including~~
~~sustained inappropriate behavior.~~

~~**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public~~
~~communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or~~
~~private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction~~
~~with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.~~
~~Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.~~

~~### 4. Permanent Ban~~

~~**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community~~
~~standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an~~
~~individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.~~
