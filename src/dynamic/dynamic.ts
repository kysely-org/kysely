  /**
   * Creates a dynamic reference to a column that is not know at compile time.
   *
   * Kysely is built in a way that by default you can't refer to tables or columns
   * that are not actually visible in the current query and context. This is all
   * done by typescript at compile time, which means that you need to know the
   * columns and tables at compile time. This is not always the case of course.
   *
   * This method is meant to be used in those cases where the column names
   * come from the user input or are not otherwise known at compile time.
   *
   * WARNING! Unlike values, column names are not escaped by the database engine
   * or Kysely and if you pass in unchecked column names using this method, you
   * create an SQL injection vulnerability. Always __always__ validate the user
   * input before passing it to this method.
   *
   * There are couple of examples below for some use cases, but you can pass
   * `ref` to other methods as well. If the types allow you to pass a `ref`
   * value to some place, it should work.
   *
   * @example
   * Filter by a column not know at compile time:
   *
   * ```ts
   * async function someQuery(filterColumn: string, filterValue: string) {
   *   const { ref } = db.dynamic
   *
   *   return await db
   *     .selectFrom('person')
   *     .selectAll()
   *     .where(ref(filterColumn), '=', filterValue)
   *     .execute()
   * }
   *
   * someQuery('first_name', 'Arnold')
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * Order by a column not know at compile time:
   *
   * ```ts
   * async function someQuery(orderBy: string) {
   *   const { ref } = db.dynamic
   *
   *   return await db
   *     .selectFrom('person')
   *     .select('person.first_name as fn')
   *     .orderBy(ref(orderBy))
   *     .execute()
   * }
   *
   * someQuery('fn')
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * In this example we add selections dynamically:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const { ref } = db.dynamic
   *
   * // Some column name provided by the user. Value not known at compile time.
   * const columnFromUserInput = req.params.select;
   *
   * // A type that lists all possible values `columnFromUserInput` can have.
   * // You can use `keyof Person` if any column of an interface is allowed.
   * type PossibleColumns = 'last_name' | 'first_name' | 'birth_date'
   *
   * const [person] = await db.selectFrom('person')
   *   .select([
   *     ref<PossibleColumns>(columnFromUserInput)
   *     'id'
   *   ])
   *   .execute()
   *
   * // The resulting type contains all `PossibleColumns` as optional fields
   * // because we cannot know which field was actually selected before
   * // running the code.
   * const lastName: string | undefined = person.last_name
   * const firstName: string | undefined = person.first_name
   * const birthDate: string | undefined = person.birth_date
   *
   * // The result type also contains the compile time selection `id`.
   * person.id
   * ```

    return new DynamicReferenceBuilder<R>(reference)
