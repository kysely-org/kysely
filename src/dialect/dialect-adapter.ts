  /**
   * This method is used to acquire a lock for the migrations so that
   * it's not possible for two migration operations to run in parallel.
   *
   * Most dialects have explicit locks that can be used, like advisory locks
   * in PostgreSQL and the get_lock function in MySQL.
   *
   * If the dialect doesn't have explicit locks the {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockTable}
   * created by Kysely can be used instead. You can access it through the `options` object.
   * The lock table has two columns `id` and `is_locked` and there's only one row in the table
   * whose id is {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockRowId}. `is_locked` is an integer. Kysely
   * takes care of creating the lock table and inserting the one single row to it before this
   * method is executed. If the dialect supports schemas and the user has specified a custom
   * schema in their migration settings, the options object also contains the schema name in
   * {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockTableSchema}.
   *
   * Here's an example of how you might implement this method for a dialect that doesn't
   * have explicit locks but supports `FOR UPDATE` row locks and transactional DDL:
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { DialectAdapterBase, type MigrationLockOptions, Kysely } from 'kysely'
   *
   * export class MyAdapter extends DialectAdapterBase {
   *   override async acquireMigrationLock(
   *     db: Kysely<any>,
   *     options: MigrationLockOptions
   *   ): Promise<void> {
   *     const queryDb = options.lockTableSchema
   *       ? db.withSchema(options.lockTableSchema)
   *       : db
   *
   *     // Since our imaginary dialect supports transactional DDL and has
   *     // row locks, we can simply take a row lock here and it will guarantee
   *     // all subsequent calls to this method from other transactions will
   *     // wait until this transaction finishes.
   *     await queryDb
   *       .selectFrom(options.lockTable)
   *       .selectAll()
   *       .where('id', '=', options.lockRowId)
   *       .forUpdate()
   *       .execute()
   *   }
   *
   *   override async releaseMigrationLock() {
   *     // noop
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * If `supportsTransactionalDdl` is `true` then the `db` passed to this method
   * is a transaction inside which the migrations will be executed. Otherwise
   * `db` is a single connection (session) that will be used to execute the
   * migrations.
