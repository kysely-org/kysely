# JSON Traversal

In the era of data-driven applications, SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL,
and SQLite have evolved to support JSON traversal. JSON provides a flexible and
dynamic data structure, and these databases now offer native support for storing,
querying, and manipulating JSON data within the SQL framework.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite have introduced native JSON data types, along with
functions and operators for extracting values, filtering conditions, aggregating
arrays, and indexing JSON data. This enables developers to leverage the strengths
of SQL and JSON together, combining relational querying with the flexibility of
JSON manipulation.

These capabilities have always fascinated us, and finally we are able to bring
them to Kysely and through some exploration and experimentation, we'll hopefully
land together on a solution that is both elegant, practical, and most importantly,
type-safe.

Each dialect Kysely supports at its core, has a different way of handling JSON
traversal. So this recipe will require choosing a dialect to work with:

<Tabs queryString="dialect">
  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="PostgreSQL" default></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mysql" label="MySQL"></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sqlite" label="SQLite"></TabItem>
</Tabs>
