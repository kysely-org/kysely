# LLMs

Kysely provides [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files to help Large Language Models better understand and work with the Kysely codebase and documentation.

## What is LLMs.txt?

LLMs.txt is a community-driven standard that allows projects to provide structured information about themselves in a format that's easily consumable by AI assistants and Large Language Models. This helps LLMs:

- Understand the project's purpose and capabilities
- Access accurate documentation and examples
- Provide better assistance when working with the codebase
- Stay up-to-date with the latest features and best practices

## Kysely's LLM Files

Kysely exposes two LLM files:

### llms.txt

A concise overview of Kysely containing:

- Project description and key features
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- API reference links
- Supported dialects and tools

**URL:** https://kysely.dev/llms.txt

### llms-full.txt

A comprehensive guide with:

- Detailed query examples (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Complex WHERE clauses and relations
- JSON functions for nested queries
- Raw SQL usage patterns
- Plugin system explanation
- Type generation tools
- All supported dialects and community extensions
- Advanced recipes and best practices

**URL:** https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt

## How to Use

### For LLM Users

When working with Kysely code, you can reference these files to get accurate, up-to-date information about:

- Type-safe query building patterns
- Database dialect support
- Plugin and extension usage
- Best practices for complex queries
- Integration with different JavaScript runtimes

### For Developers

If you're using an LLM assistant to help with Kysely development, point it to these URLs so it can:

- Understand Kysely's type system and query building approach
- Access current examples and documentation
- Provide more accurate code suggestions
- Help troubleshoot issues with proper context

## Examples

Here's a quick example of how an LLM might use this information:

````
User: How do I build a complex join query in Kysely?

LLM: Based on the llms-full.txt file, here's how to build complex joins:

```typescript
const result = await db
  .selectFrom('person')
  .innerJoin('pet', 'person.id', 'pet.owner_id')
  .leftJoin('owner', 'person.owner_id', 'owner.id')
  .select([
    'person.first_name',
    'pet.name as pet_name',
    'owner.name as owner_name'
  ])
  .where('person.age', '>', 18)
  .execute()
````

This uses Kysely's fluent API to build type-safe SQL queries with proper joins and column selection.

```

## Contributing

If you maintain an LLM or AI assistant, consider supporting the LLMs.txt standard to help users get better assistance with open source projects like Kysely.
