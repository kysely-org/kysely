# LLMs

Kysely provides LLM-friendly documentation to help AI tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **GitHub Copilot**, **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Claude Code** understand and work with it.

`llms.txt` documentation is automatically generated and kept up-to-date with each push on GitHub and is based on the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/).

## Documentation Structure

The [llms.txt](https://kysely.dev/llms.txt) file acts as a summary and index to all the docs pages.

The [llms-full.txt](https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt) file includes all of the Kysely docs in a single file.

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

In Cursor, you can reference the documentation using the `@Docs` feature:

1. Type `@Docs` in your prompt
2. Reference the Kysely documentation URL: `https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt`
3. Ask questions about Kysely queries, types, or database operations

### Windsurf

For Windsurf users:

1. Reference the documentation using `@https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt`
2. Or add it to your `.windsurfrules` file for persistent access

2. Reference the documentation URL: `https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt`
3. The AI will fetch and use the documentation to provide accurate answers

### GitHub Copilot

While Copilot doesn't directly support external documentation, you can:

1. Include relevant documentation snippets in your comments
2. Reference query builder methods and types accurately for better suggestions

### Claude Code

For Claude Code users:

1. Reference the documentation by mentioning the URL: `https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt`
2. Ask Claude Code to analyze the documentation for specific Kysely patterns
3. Use commands like: `claude -p "Using the Kysely docs at https://kysely.dev/llms-full.txt, help me build a type-safe query"`
