# Complex values

In addition to primitives, the values can also be arbitrary expressions.
You can build the expressions by using a callback and calling the methods
on the expression builder passed to it:

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  complexValues
} from './0040-complex-values'

<Playground code={complexValues} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
