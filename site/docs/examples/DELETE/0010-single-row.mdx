:::info More examples
The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/)
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [deleteFrom method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/Kysely.html#deleteFrom)
 - [returning method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/DeleteQueryBuilder.html#returning)
