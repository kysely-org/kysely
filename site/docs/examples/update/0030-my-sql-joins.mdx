# MySQL joins

MySQL allows you to join tables directly to the "main" table and update
rows of all joined tables. This is possible by passing all tables to the
`updateTable` method as a list and adding the `ON` conditions as `WHERE`
statements. You can then use the `set(column, value)` variant to update
columns using table qualified names.

The `UpdateQueryBuilder` also has `innerJoin` etc. join methods, but those
can only be used as part of a PostgreSQL `update set from join` query.
Due to type complexity issues, we unfortunately can't make the same
methods work in both cases.

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={mySqlJoins} setupCode={exampleSetup} />

The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/),
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [set method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/UpdateQueryBuilder.html#set)
 - [returning method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/UpdateQueryBuilder.html#returning)
 - [updateTable method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/Kysely.html#updateTable)
