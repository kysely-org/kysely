# Simple transaction

This example inserts two rows in a transaction. If an error is thrown inside
the callback passed to the `execute` method, the transaction is rolled back.
Otherwise it's committed.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  simpleTransaction
} from './0010-simple-transaction'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={simpleTransaction} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
</div>
