# Simple transaction

This example inserts two rows in a transaction. If an exception is thrown inside
the callback passed to the `execute` method,
1. the exception is caught,
2. the transaction is rolled back, and
3. the exception is thrown again.
Otherwise the transaction is committed.

import { Playground } from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  simpleTransaction
} from './0010-simple-transaction'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={simpleTransaction} />
</div>
