# Complex selections

You can select arbitrary expression including subqueries and raw sql snippets.
When you do that, you need to give a name for the selections using the `as` method:

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  complexSelections
} from './0050-complex-selections'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={complexSelections} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
</div>
