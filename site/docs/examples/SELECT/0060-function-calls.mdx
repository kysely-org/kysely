# Function calls

This example shows how to create function calls. These examples also work in any
other place (`where` calls, updates, inserts etc.). The only difference is that you
leave out the alias (the `as` call) if you use these in any other place than `select`.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  functionCalls
} from './0060-function-calls'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={functionCalls} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
</div>

:::info More examples
The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/),
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [select method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/SelectQueryBuilder.html#select)
 - [selectAll method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/SelectQueryBuilder.html#selectAll)
 - [selectFrom method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/Kysely.html#selectFrom)
