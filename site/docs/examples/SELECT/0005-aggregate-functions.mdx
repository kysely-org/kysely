# Aggregate functions

The [fn](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/interfaces/FunctionModule.html) property of the
[ExpressionBuilder](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/interfaces/ExpressionBuilder.html)
has shortcuts to the most common aggregate functions like `count` and `sum`. You can call
an arbitrary aggregate function using ghe `agg` method.
