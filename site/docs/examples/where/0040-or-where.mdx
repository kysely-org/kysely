# OR where

To combine conditions using `OR`, you can use the expression builder.
There are two ways to create `OR` expressions. Both are shown in this
example:

import { Playground } from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  orWhere
} from './0040-or-where'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={orWhere} />
</div>

The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/),
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [where method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/SelectQueryBuilder.html#where)
 - [whereRef method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/SelectQueryBuilder.html#whereRef)
