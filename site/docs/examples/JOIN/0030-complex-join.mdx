# Complex join

You can provide a function as the second argument to get a join
builder for creating more complex joins. The join builder has a
bunch of `on*` methods for building the `on` clause of the join.
There's basically an equivalent for every `where` method
(`on`, `onRef` etc.). You can do all the same things with the
`on` method that you can with the corresponding `where` method.
See the `where` method documentation for more examples.
