# Complex join

You can provide a function as the second argument to get a join
builder for creating more complex joins. The join builder has a
bunch of `on*` methods for building the `on` clause of the join.
There's basically an equivalent for every `where` method
(`on`, `onRef` etc.). You can do all the same things with the
`on` method that you can with the corresponding `where` method.
See the `where` method documentation for more examples.

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  complexJoin
} from './0030-complex-join'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={complexJoin} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
</div>

:::info More examples
The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/)
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [innerJoin method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#innerJoin)
 - [leftJoin method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#leftJoin)
 - [rightJoin method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#rightJoin)
 - [fullJoin method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#fullJoin)
