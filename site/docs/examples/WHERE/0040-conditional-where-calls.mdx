# Conditional where calls

You can add expressions conditionally like this:

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  conditionalWhereCalls
} from './0040-conditional-where-calls'

<Playground code={conditionalWhereCalls} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
