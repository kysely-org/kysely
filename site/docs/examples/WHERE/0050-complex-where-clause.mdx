# Complex where clause

For complex `where` expressions you can pass in a single callback and
use the `ExpressionBuilder` to build your expression:

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  complexWhereClause
} from './0050-complex-where-clause'

<Playground code={complexWhereClause} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
