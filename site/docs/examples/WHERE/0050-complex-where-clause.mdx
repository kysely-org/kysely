# Complex where clause

For complex `where` expressions you can pass in a single callback and
use the `ExpressionBuilder` to build your expression:

import {
  Playground,
  exampleSetup,
} from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  complexWhereClause
} from './0050-complex-where-clause'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={complexWhereClause} setupCode={exampleSetup} />
</div>

:::info More examples
The API documentation is packed with examples. The API docs are hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/)
but you can access the same documentation by hovering over functions/methods/classes in your IDE. The examples are always
just one hover away!

For example, check out these sections:
 - [where method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#where)
 - [whereRef method](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely/classes/SelectQueryBuilder.html#whereRef)
