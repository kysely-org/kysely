# Inserts, updates and deletions

Some databases like postgres also allow you to run other queries than selects
in CTEs. On these databases CTEs are extremely powerful:

import { Playground } from '../../../src/components/Playground'

import {
  insertsUpdatesAndDeletions
} from './0020-inserts-updates-and-deletions'

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1em' }}>
  <Playground code={insertsUpdatesAndDeletions} />
</div>
