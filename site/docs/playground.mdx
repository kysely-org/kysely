# Playground

[@wirekang](https://github.com/wirekang) has created a [playground for Kysely](https://kyse.link). You can use it to quickly test stuff out and for creating code examples for your issues, PRs and Discord messages.

import { Playground, exampleFilterById } from '../src/components/Playground'

<Playground code={exampleFilterById} />

## Codesandbox

We also have a minimal [code sandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/kysely-demo-9l099t?file=/src/index.tsx:0-36).
